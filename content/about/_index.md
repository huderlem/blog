This is my personal blog, which I'll use to write about things I find interesting. A lot of it will be related to video game reverse engineering projects, since that's where most of my hobby time is devoted. I hope it will be fun to read.

The name "Shanty Blog" looks a bit strange, but I often use the handle "ShantyTown" online. That name originates from this card from Dominion: http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Shanty_Town. It was sitting on my desk one day when I was trying to come up with a handle name.
